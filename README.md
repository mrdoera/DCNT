DenseNet for Tracking or Dense Connected Residual Net for Tracking
This work is just a half-baked idea of mine, inspired by Dense Connection in DenseNet.
The CREST which applies residual learning into tracking uses features from only one layer. 
Inspired by DenseNet, I make a try to connect features from other layers to the Residual Learning part.
The results was not satisfying and the demo needs to be improved.
